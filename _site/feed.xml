The original film prints, which are unique, are held in climate-controlled vaults in order to prevent further physical deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the films have been registered and documented, the IFI has not catalogued them in detail as they will need remedial conservation work before they can be properly viewed. Prior to their arrival at the IFI, the reels were held in unsuitable conditions, which caused some physical and chemical deterioration, including shrinkage and colour fade. Because the reels were screened regularly whilst in Archdeacon Doherty’s possession, many of them are quite dirty and fragile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this juncture, it is essential that the material be comprehensively assessed, catalogued, digitised and preserved, both to prevent its further deterioration and to make it accessible for research and exhibition. Before it can be viewed and catalogued by the IFI team, the material will need to undergo remedial conservation work, including physical repair at the 1F1 and chemical rinsing and ultrasonic cleaning at a film laboratory in the Netherlands. The wire recordings will need to be sent to the USA for conversion to high-resolution audio files. On their return, the film elements will be examined on flatbed editing tables and sorted according to their suitability for digitisation; their content and condition will be assessed, and technical and filmographic reports will be created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the size and physical condition of the collection, most of the material has not been digitised and is consequently unavailable for viewing. What has been digitised exists only on standard-definition video. in order to protect the original film prints and at the same time make the footage accessible, particularly to Donegal communities, a high-resolution (2K) scan will need to be undertaken. The newly conserved and catalogued prints could then be returned to their vaults for preservation, and the transferred footage and audio could be made available to Donegal libraries and communities, students, researchers and programme makers, both on-site in an exhibition context in Donegal and via the IFI player, which gives online global access to Irish film collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervention is essential now, so that this unique and fragile collection from Donegal can be preserved and made available for this and future generations, in Ireland and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

A Rameltonborn parish priest, who became a canon and archdeacon in the Arch-Diocese of Raphoe, Fr Tommy Doherty was, apart from being a clergyman, a filmmaker and cinema owner. An enterprising and popular pastor, he was named Donegal Man of the Year in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fr Doherty began filming shortly after his ordination in 1927. From the first years of his ministry in Donegal. he recorded everyday activities and special occasions in his locality and beyond, capturing half a century of Donegal life on film. Tvici.e than simply a personal record of friends and family, Fr Doherty’s films constitute a living archive of community activities, traditions and pastimes which would otherwise have gone unrecorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, Fr Doherty’s camera caught for posterity the journey of the last train from Creslough to Burtonport in 1941, the patients and staff at Castlerea TB hospital and a mobile TB X-ray machine visiting Donegal communities, including Arranmore Island. His film collection documents fair-days, parades and processions, sheepdog trials, fishing, turf-cutting, sowing and harvesting, weddings and funerals, and many other local events and activities. It also includes footage of rural electrification in Donegal, workers at the Convoy Woolen Mills, and leisure pursuits such as pony jumping and the Burtonport Regatta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ireland doesn’t have as rich a history of indigenous professional production as other western countries, and this makes Irish non-professional film collections all the rrore significant. Although many of the subjects of Fr Doherty’s lens may seem commonplace to the modern viewer, his films offer an alternative view of Ireland and frequently provide the sole moving-image record of a specific event, place or aspect of history, culture or society. Over time, these films have grown in value and significance: a film of a family occasion or local event may nue.. be a fascinating reot-e o:.= a custom that has died out or of a landscape that has changed beyond recognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to his endeavours behind the camera, Fr Doherty ran commercial cinemas in Convoy and Donegal Town. He would supplement the commercial programme with his films of local activities, giving the locals an opportunity to see themselves on the big screen. Proceeds from the film screenings were used To maintain the church and parish house and to generate new community building projects. Fr Doherty’s work is celebrated in the 1985 RTE documentary, Filling the Fourpenny Seats, in which he also stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1980 RTE commissioned a series of television documentaries to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of Eamon de Valera which was to take place in 1982. The series was called “The Age of De Valera” . I was assigned as producer-director of the series. As part of my research for the series I put out a call on the Gay Byrne radio show for any members of the public who might have old film from the first half of the 20th century lying around in their attics. There was already an archive of Irish life from the 1920s onwards. These were mostly cinema newsreels made by companies such as Pathé and Gaumont which had been made largely for showing in British cinema newsreels. There were also some newsreels made specifically for Irish audiences by Movietone. The subject matter of these newsreels was quite limited and there was little visual record of everyday life in Ireland for the first decades after independence. What “amateur” images survived tended to be of the affluent, the cost of film was far beyond the means of most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the responses I received was from Fr Tommy Doherty, Parish Priest in Dunfanaghy. County Donegal. I distinctly remember driving up to Donegal on a cold stormy night and arriving at Fr Doherty’s house. He offered to show me his reels of film, explaining that he had compiled local newsreels of everyday life as an incentive to get people into the cinema he ran at the time. He said that he knew people would come to see his newsreels and stay on for the feature films he was showing. He was running his cinema shows to give his people somewhere to meet and enjoy themselves. He had got his first camera when he was working in Scotland in the 1920s and when he returned to his native Donegal he began recording everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he showed me that night in Dunfanaghy was a unique visual record of the lives of everyday people in Donegal from the 1930s to the 1950s. images of fairs, train journeys, processions, town life, markets, harvesting, etc came from his projector. I was very excited. Fr Doherty had a treasure trove of visual images which were not just of local importance, but also of national importance.
A small amount of his films were brought to RTE in Dublin and copied for Inclusion in “The Age of De Valera” series.
I was acutely conscious that there was a danger of Fr Doherty’s film being lost to the nation. After completion of the De Valera series ! approached Fr Doherty about the possibility of making a once-off documentary based on his film. Fr Doherty generously agreed to my proposal. Almost all his film was taken to Dublin to be cleaned up, re-spliced and copied. In 1985 RTE transmitted “Filling the Fourpenny Seats”, a documentary based on Fr Doherty’s film, including Fr Doherty’s own reminisces of the everyday lives of his parishioners in Donegal in the interwar years. As the cost of restoring film was so expensive, not all Fr Doherty’s film was restored. only the parts that were likely to be included in the documentary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pr Doherty’s film trove is an important part of the visual history of the Free State in the first decades of independence. They show in colour a way of life in rural Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Threshing Day&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fr Doherty’s film trove is an important part of the visual history of the Free State in the first decades of independence. They show in colour a way of life in rural if land which is an important part of our heritage. Film is fragile and is very vulnerable to damage, through projection, through handling, through degeneration over time. The Irish Film Institute is the custodian of the National Film Archive. My understanding is that in the decade after Fr Doherty’s death his archive was given by the Diocese of Raphoe to the National Film Archive for safe-keeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Fr Doherty’s film is to survive as part of the national heritage it is essential that it be digitalised and made safe for future generations. It would be unconscionable if his film were to be lost through neglect; its local and national importance cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;
