This collection comprises approximately 29,000ft (18 hours) of film and several wire recordings. The original film prints, which are unique, are held in climate-controlled vaults in order to prevent further physical deterioration.

Although the films have been registered and documented, the IFI has not catalogued them in detail as they will need remedial conservation work before they can be properly viewed. Prior to their arrival at the IFI, the reels were held in unsuitable conditions, which caused some physical and chemical deterioration, including shrinkage and colour fade. Because the reels were screened regularly whilst in Archdeacon Doherty's possession, many of them are quite dirty and fragile.





At this juncture, it is essential that the material be comprehensively assessed, catalogued, digitised and preserved, both to prevent its further deterioration and to make it accessible for research and exhibition. Before it can be viewed and catalogued by the IFI team, the material will need to undergo remedial conservation work, including physical repair at the 1F1 and chemical rinsing and ultrasonic cleaning at a film laboratory in the Netherlands. The wire recordings will need to be sent to the USA for conversion to high-resolution audio files. On their return, the film elements will be examined on flatbed editing tables and sorted according to their suitability for digitisation; their content and condition will be assessed, and technical and filmographic reports will be created.

Because of the size and physical condition of the collection, most of the material has not been digitised and is consequently unavailable for viewing. What has been digitised exists only on standard-definition video. in order to protect the original film prints and at the same time make the footage accessible, particularly to Donegal communities, a high-resolution (2K) scan will need to be undertaken. The newly conserved and catalogued prints could then be returned to their vaults for preservation, and the transferred footage and audio could be made available to Donegal libraries and communities, students, researchers and programme makers, both on-site in an exhibition context in Donegal and via the IFI player, which gives online global access to Irish film collections.

Intervention is essential now, so that this unique and fragile collection from Donegal can be preserved and made available for this and future generations, in Ireland and around the world.
